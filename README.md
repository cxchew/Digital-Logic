<details>
    <summary>Abouts</summary>
    In this chapter, we learned about two different types of counters, which are synchronous and asynchronous counter and how both counters executes in a digital circuits.At the same time, differences between both counters also being introduced. This chapter also introduce us with the example of the design of the counters. With all this understanding, we able to know more about counters and its uses in our daily basis.
</details>



**9) <ins>Chapter 9: Shift registers**

     This chapter is the final chapter of the course. It introduces us with shift registers, its characteristic, function, and types. The shift register also able to produce two sequences, Ring counter and Johnson counter. Through the chapter, we able to learn about the how the shift registers functions and what its role in the digital circuit.

## Reflection
Through this Digital Logic course, I have provided with many valuable knowledges about digital electronics. From the first part, I learned key concepts and practical applications for combinational logic circuit that help me to have deeper understanding about digital electronics. While from the second part, I have explored many topics such as sequential logic corcuit and shift register that gave us insight about how the digital device function in our daily life. Overall, the course gave me an insight about our digital world.
